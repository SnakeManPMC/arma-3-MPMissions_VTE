Call in these teams on your AN/PRC Radio if you get in trouble, especially when you ambush the marching infantry. If things go wrong, call in a team to help you get the job done, or cover your extraction.<br/><br/>1) Pink Team:<br/>An OH-6A and AH1J will patrol your AO, looking for enemy. They will operate independant of your unit, but will stay near your general postion. If the ambush goes wrong, and the NVA troops flee or get away, call in this team to help clean up the scattered enemy.<br/><br/>2) Red Team:<br/>Two AH1 Cobras will provide CAS. Call in the red team if you want your squad to direct the CAS. They will join you. The Cobras will take a few minutes to arrive."]];

You may hear them if they engage, but will be too far to help them, or for them to help you."]];

Your target is an NVA convoy of infantry, moving from the <marker = 'jung'>jungles</marker> to this <marker = 'camp'>NVA camp</marker>.<br/><br/>A UH-1H crashed along the river during the night, with claymore cargo.

There is not much time."]];
