<b>PRELIMINARY BRIEFING</b>
</p>

<h4>
10th Platoon, SEAL Team Two
<br>
Ia Drang Valley/12Sep69
<br>
<br>
One of our agent handlers sent in a report on a district police chief on the take. It seems this man has offered a tax collector and his bodyguards free passage through the area for a small cut of the profits and for his home village and family to be left alone.
<br>
<br>
Your team will be tasked with the elimination of the tax collector.
<br>
<br>
We have been trying to cross check this aginst any intel NILO has or against anything our agents have found out, but have come up short on both counts. I would normally pass something like this up, but we really need a win in this AO to bolster our support amongst the locals.
<br>
<br>
That is all.
