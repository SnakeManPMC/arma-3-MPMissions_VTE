<br>
<br>
Welcome to II Corps. 10th Platoon, Seal Team Two, has been moved north into the Ia Drang Valley since our arrival a month ago taking over from 7th Platoon.
<br>
<br>
Our mission during this tour is to attempt to slow the flow of troops that are pouring through the valley heading south by eliminating the VCI cadre in the area.
<br>
<br>
We will take things one step at a time and use all of the knowledge we gained in the delta to continue our success here in the North.
<br>
<br>
Now for our first mission.
<br>
<br>
A notorious <marker name='taxer'>VCI tax collector</marker> named Tu' Phan is the main target for this mission. While "dead men tell no tales," our first priority is to project fear into the ranks of the VC and VCI. Our intel will come over time.
<br>
<br>
Through the local chieu hoi center we were able to find out that recently reactivated VC Regiment 271, in coordination with NVA advisors, have been trying to divert attention away from the target area in the hopes that our conventional units, such as those from the 4th Infantry Division, will take the bait and focus their efforts elsewhere. 
<br>
<br>
If we can take out this man it will boost not only our support with the local populace, it will also mean that the local VC will have a harder time finding sources of food and supplies locally and will have to depend on either supplies from the north, or will have to take what they need by force, which will just push the locals into our arms..
<br>
<br>
Insertion will be by Light Seal Support Craft at 040012SEP69.
Have your squad equipped and ready for transfer to LSSC by 020512SEP69. <br><br>
All equipment check-outs, rehearsals, and gear checks must be completed by that time.<br><br>

<h2><a name="intel'>FIVE PARAGRAPH ORDER</marker></h2>
<h4>
<p>

<b>1)</b>
 The start of our plans for the elimination of the local VC terrorist activity in the Ia Drang area requires the destruction of a <marker name='taxer'> VCI tax collector named Tu' Phan.</marker> South of the DMZ, this man has about as much pull as uncle Ho himself. The legend of this man goes back to his days as a Viet Minh company commander. Through the years he has proven himself to be very loyal to his cause, even though he always knew he would never be able to become a party member. He has risen though the ranks to become one of the most feared and influential men in the south. Due to his rank and the amount of money that he may be carrying, he is expected to have any number of bodyguards and possibly a platoon or two of security in the vicinity.
<br>
<br>
<b>2)</b>
 The mission also calls for the securement of extraction site <marker name='Xray'>Xray</marker>, from which your team will be extracted by LSSC, manned by sailors from our attached MST.
<br>
<br>
<b>3)</b>
 Your squad will infiltrate the camp and complete the mission by any means necessary. The surrounding huts house vietnamese civilians so be careful where you shoot. Any civilian casualties on this mission will greatly affect how we are viewed in the valley and may affect future operations negatively by giving credence to the localized VC propaganda efforts.

<b>Size:</b>
<br>
The areas surrounding the village may contain security elements tasked with protecting Tu' Phan. While large company to batallion size movements are taking place in the southern part of the valley, this does not mean this mission will be a cakewalk. We know that there are still enemy in this AO, but as of this time, the exact location and headcount has not been confirmed other than the troops thought to be in the vicinity of our target.
<br>
<br>

<b>Activity:</b>
<br>
The local Mike Force has encountered considerably less contacts over the last few days in this area. This would seem to coroborate the story given to us by the Hoi Chan. 
<br>
<br>

<b>Unit:</b>
<br>
We believe that elements of VC Regiment 271 may be in the area, being used to protect both the village and routes to and from the village. 
<br>
<br>

<b>Time:</b>
<br>
Our most current information is dated 150010SEP69. A bit old. More patrols could have been sent in by now from the southern part of the valley after being harassed by Special Forces and their Montagnard troops.
<br>

<b>Equipment:</b>
<br>
Unknown at this time, but most likely small arms, booby traps and possibly RPGs.

<h2><a name="HELP'>Helpful hints to successfully complete the mission</marker></h2>
<h4>
<p>

<b>1st-</b>  Read your orders thoroughly.
<br>
<br>
<b>2nd-</b>  Familiarize yourself with the terrain, waypoints, radio freqs, and enemy equipment and positions before embarking on the mission.
<br>
<br>
<b>3rd-</b>  Use the time acceleration function to move quickly rather than running everywhere. Patience is a virtue.
<br>
<br>
<b>4th-</b>  Make use of your machine gunners wisely. Ideally you should keep them in positions where they can lay down covering fire in the case of a retreat.
<br>
<br>
<b>5th-</b>  Staying still when detected will only increase the chances of your team being found.
<br>
<br>
<b>6th-</b>  This is not an bodycount mission. One of your men alive is worth more than twenty enemy dead.
<br>
<br>
<b>7th-</b>  If you must use force, be fast and decisive. Don't give the enemy time to surround your position.
<br>
<br>
<b>8th-</b>  Use the commands wisely to avoid having your team initiate contact too early.
<br>
<br>
<b>9th-</b>  If your radioman goes down, someone else on the team must take it or radio commands won't work.

Not one of these targets is worth the life of you, or one of your team. Casualties are inevitable, but try to keep them to a minimum..

While your men come first, the mission goals should still be taken into consideration even after being compromised. <br>  
You will have few chances to redeem yourself in the future. Your leadership skills will be watched closely from now on.
