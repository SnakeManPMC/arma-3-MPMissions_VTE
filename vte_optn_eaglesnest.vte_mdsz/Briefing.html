<!-- [PLAN] -->
                    Operation Eagles Nestn<br><br>This mission in VC country requires you to Destroy an ammo store and capture the enemy Head Quarters. <br>Sounds easy right?.<br>WRONG ! the enmy HQ is On the top of the highest point on the island and is patroled by many VC troops also the camp itself is fortified with AA and mortors.<br>At the base (marked) is the ammo store you need to destroy, this too is well defended and from here an armor division of Tanks ,shilkas and troops leaves to  setup a reinforcement base near to your forward camp.<br>You can choose to start from the main base where you have choppers or from the forward camp.At both places you can set VD and recruit troops also you have a teleport option to travel from base to camp and back,The helis respawn at the main base and your vehicles at the camp.<br>The Mission uses group respawn so when you recruit a squad of troops you respawn as a member of that group when you killed,untill all are killed then you respawn at the forward camp.<br><br>So thats it your mission is to capture the base and destroy the Ammo dump.<br> Enjoy RedRum
